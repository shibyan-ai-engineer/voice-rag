# GIF Animation Placeholders

This directory should contain the following GIF animations for the UI:

1. `listening_for_wakeword.gif` - Animation for when the system is waiting for the wake word "Friday"
2. `wakeword_detected.gif` - Animation for when the wake word is detected
3. `listening_for_prompt.gif` - Animation for when the system is recording the user's prompt
4. `processing_query.gif` - Animation for when the system is processing the query
5. `speaking_response.gif` - Animation for when the system is speaking the response
6. `error.gif` - Animation for when there's an error

You can create your own GIFs or find suitable ones online.

For development purposes, simply copy the same placeholder GIF for all these files.
