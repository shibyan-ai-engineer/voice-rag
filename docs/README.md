## Demo GIF

The `demo.gif` should be a short animation showing the Voice RAG assistant in action, demonstrating:
1. Uploading a PDF document
2. Activating with "Friday" wake word
3. Asking a question
4. Getting a spoken response

To create a demo GIF:
1. Record a screen capture of the application in use
2. Convert to GIF format (you can use tools like ScreenToGif, LICEcap, or FFmpeg)
3. Optimize the GIF for web display (keep file size reasonable)
4. Place it in this directory as `demo.gif`

The demo GIF is referenced in the main README.md file.
